# Wavvy -- framework agnostic JSON data transformer and JSON REST API helpers

## Description/Concept/Goals

Just wanted to build a library that adds some syntactic sugar/helpers for building REST APIs.
Library is obviously unstable and still in concept, but you have to start somewhere right? 

### Ideas

- have this tied to the JSON API spec - ![http://jsonapi.org/][http://jsonapi.org/]
- follow HTTP 1/2 spec.
- syntactic sugar for large JSON data and transforming data based on user's use case
